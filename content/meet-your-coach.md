Hi, I’m Andrea - a 44-year-old mom of two, Certified Nutrition Coach, and someone who has collected more medical plot twists than most TV dramas. I’ve navigated a complicated pregnancy, treatment for a rare tumor, a hysterectomy, and even open-heart surgery for a congenital defect. (If you ever need someone to fill out complicated hospital paperwork quickly, I’m your girl.)

Going through all of that completely reshaped how I think about health, stress, and self-care. Spoiler: it’s not about perfection, restriction, or pretending celery juice is a personality.

With the help of my own coach, I rebuilt my habits from scratch. I left a high-stress career, healed my relationship with food, gave up alcohol, started resistance training, and even completed an 80-mile hike through the Cotswolds - yes, on purpose. And I learned one of the most life-changing truths out there: there are no “bad” foods, and fad diets deserve to retire permanently.

Real change comes from building skills, self-compassion, and learning to choose what your body actually needs (instead of what the latest wellness trend told you to fear).
Through loss, stress, and all the beautiful chaos of life, these skills helped me stay grounded instead of falling back into old patterns. That transformation inspired me to dive deep into nutrition science, behavior change, and sustainable habits…and eventually become a coach myself.

Today, I’m here to support you with the same empathy, research-backed guidance, and cheerleading that helped me rebuild my own life. I’m your coach, your motivator, and the person who will remind you that you’re doing better than you think.
Let’s help you feel strong, energized, and confident in your body, starting now.

Because truly… **You Can Do It.**
