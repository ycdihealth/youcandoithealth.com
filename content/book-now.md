## Let's Talk About Your Goals

Ready to start your health journey? Book a session directly using the calendar below. 

This 20-30 minute call is a chance for us to get to know each other, talk about your health goals, and see if my coaching program is the right fit for you. You’ll share what you’ve been struggling with, what you want to achieve, and what your day-to-day lifestyle looks like.

I’ll walk you through how my evidence-based personalized coaching works, what support is included, and what you can expect in the first few weeks together.

No pressure, no sales pitch - just a genuine conversation about what you want for your health and how I can help you get there.

Choose a time that works best for you, and I'll see you soon!
