# youcandoithealth.com

This was created by following Hugo's [Quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/):

```
hugo new site youcandoithealth.com
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
hugo
```

And the workflow was created from the instructions [here](https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/host-on-github-pages/).
